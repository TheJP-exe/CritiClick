# CritiClick
CritiClick is a full-stack web application that allows users to browse movies and write reviews for them. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend) and a Node.js + Express + MongoDB (backend) stack, this project demonstrates end-to-end development of a modern, data-driven movie review platform.
